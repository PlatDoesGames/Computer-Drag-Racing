# Computer-Drag-Racing
Ever wanted to drag race your friends? Now you can! Simply run the python script, and compare your times with your friends.

To use, simply download the LargeNumberCounter.py file, go into your command prompt, and type "python path\to\directory\LargeNumberCounter.py".

Once open, it will prompt you for a number to count to. For best results, 100,000 to 250,000 are good choices to get a quick result and 1,000,000 will take around 30-70 seconds depending on your processor speed. Once run, it will display every number and once it reaches the number you entered, it will display the time elasped.
